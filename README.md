# Business Data Management Capstone Project  
Enhancing Operational Efficiency at SFP Sons

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete work for my Business Data Management (BDM) Capstone Project, completed as part of the BS in Data Science and Applications program at IIT Madras.

The project is an independent, end-to-end business analytics study conducted with a real B2B fragrance manufacturing firm. The objective is to identify operational inefficiencies and demand–supply mismatches using primary business data and structured analytical techniques.

## Business Context
SFP Sons (India) Pvt. Ltd. is a B2B fragrance manufacturer with a wide product portfolio.  
Despite strong demand for certain products, the firm faces challenges such as:
- Overproduction of low-impact products  
- Missed sales due to unfulfilled demand  
- Inefficient allocation of production resources  

This project analyzes these challenges using data-driven methods and presents actionable insights to support better operational decision-making.
